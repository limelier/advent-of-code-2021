Advent of Code 2021
___________________

This is a Kotlin program for solving `this year's Advent of Code challenges <https://adventofcode.com/2021>`.

My puzzle inputs are found in `this directory <src/resources/inputs/<zero_padded_day>.txt>`.
If you wish to test out a solution with your input, you can change the text in the corresponding file.

More solutions will be added as the advent calendar progresses.
