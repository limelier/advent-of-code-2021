# Advent of Code 2021

This is a Kotlin program for solving [this year's Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

My puzzle inputs are found in [this directory](src/main/resources/inputs).
If you wish to test out a solution with your input, you can change the text in the corresponding file.

More solutions will be added as the advent calendar progresses.
